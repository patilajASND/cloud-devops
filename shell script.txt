separation

|
feature branches 
when a new feature is got into the branch so we create the new sub feature branches so it can be tested and 

1.master branch 
2.feature branch 
3.release branch  for a stable 
4.hot fix branches
5.

=========================================

Ansible

password less authentication for 

ssh private Ip 


ssh-keygen to create the file authentication file for 

path for the ssh-keygen is /home/ubuntu/.ssh

it is created the file 

id_rsa is private

id_rsa.pub is public key always take a public key for the use ..


1. we created the private key and public  
using the ssh-keygen 

2.then copied the public key form the id_rsa.pub 

3. created the target server and same we created the ssh-keygen private and pubic key .
4.we vim the authorized_keys file and pasted the public key content in that.
